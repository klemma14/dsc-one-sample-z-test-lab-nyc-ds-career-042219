    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and explain use cases for a one-sample z-test\n",
    "* Set up null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "* Calculate z-statistic using z-tables and CDF functions\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret p-value for significance of results\n",

    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "A fast food chain claims that the mean time to order food at their restaurants is 60 seconds, with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. You decide to take this claim to the test and go to one of the restaurants to observe actual waiting times. You take a sample of 36 customers and find that the mean order time was 75 seconds. Does this finding prove enough evidence to contradict the fast food chain's claim of fast service?\n",
